  <h3>Chess 4K Engine</h3>

</div>

## Overview

A c++ NNUE chess engine that doesn't fits into 4KiB

It supports the following subset of the UCI protocol:

- `uci`
- `isready`
- `position startpos moves ...`
- `go wtime ... btime ...`
- `quit`

Additional support for non-4K builds:

- `ucinewgame`
- `position fen ... moves ...`
- `go infinite`

The first message is always regarded as `uci` due to the space restriction

## Building

Building c4ke requires `g++` that supports `c++23`:

```
git clone https://github.com/sgtqwq/CakeChess
cd c4ke
make c4ke
```



## Minification

Outdated.

The minifier isn't general-purpose and won't work on all c++ code

- Removing whitespaces
- Removing single-line comments
- Removing `#ifdef` blocks (usually for OpenBench compliance code)
- Finding and replacing `#define` constants
- Renaming identifiers
